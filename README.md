The goal of this project is to be able to detect and classify object while using a camera and/or a radar.<br>

We started by doing it only with a camera.<br>
For this, we used the Deep-Learning algorithm called YOLO (You Only Look Once).<br>
With the camera, we focused on detecting and classifying human and chair although it would work with every class from COCO.<br>
The camera that we used is a ZED 2i. It was on a desktop with those specs:<br>
-CPU:<br>
-GPU:<br>
-RAM:<br>
-Windows<br>

We did another version of the program so it could work on a laptop using the integrated camera.<br>
It was tried and worked on a laptop with those specs:<br>
-CPU: Intel Core i5-8250U 1.80GHz<br>
-GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2Gb<br>
-RAM: DDR4 16Gb 2400MHz<br>
-Windows11 Home<br>

The biggest difference between both version is that thanks to the ZED camera, we can have the distance between the object and the camera.<br>
